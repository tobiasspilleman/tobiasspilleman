### Hey there! I'm Tobi 👋🏻

I'm Tobias, a business informatics student based in Germany.

I like to experiment and build software projects based on ideas and concepts I´m interested in. In the future, I would like to build up a portfolio of projects with a well thought-out structure and design. Feel free to join me on this journey as I´m just getting startet building them on GitHub!

From a technical point of view, I am very interested in web and mobile development and how to create interesting user interfaces. But I also think it's interesting how systems are structured and designed under the surface and would like to explore the world of system architectures.
